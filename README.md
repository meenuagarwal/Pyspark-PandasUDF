# Pyspark-PandasUDF
In my Last Project, I got the chance to work with Pyspark on [Databricks](http://databricks.com). It was a difficult transition at the start since I am used to working with Pandas in Python and the wide range of functionality offered by Pandas. So during my stint with Pyspark, I discovered some very useful features which helps a lot when you have experience with Pandas.
