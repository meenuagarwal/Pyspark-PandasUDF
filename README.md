In my Last ML Project, I got the chance to work with Pyspark on [Databricks](http://databricks.com). PySpark is a great language to learn in order to create more scalable analyses and pipelines. It was a difficult transition at the start since I am used to working with Pandas in Python and the wide range of functionality offered by Pandas. So during my stint with Pyspark, I discovered some very useful features which helps a lot when you have experience with Pandas. Mostly, I want to focus on two major features - [Koalas](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Pandas UDF](https://databricks.com/blog/2017/10/30/introducing-vectorized-udfs-for-pyspark.html).
